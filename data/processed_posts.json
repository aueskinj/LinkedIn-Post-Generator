    "text": "Correlation does not imply causation. \n\nWe repeat this phrase endlessly in Statistics 101, yet we often ignore it when building predictive models in production. In standard Machine Learning, we are often satisfied with merely exploiting correlations to minimize MSE (Mean Squared Error). \n\nBut in policy-making or strategy, prediction isn't enough. We need interventions. \n\nIf I discount a product, will sales actually go up, or were those customers going to buy anyway? \n\nThis is where Causal AI enters the room. Moving from Judea Pearl's 'Association' rung to the 'Intervention' rung requires a different mindset. \n\nTools like DoWhy and CausalML are finally bridging the gap, allowing us to explicitly model confounders rather than hoping our random forest implicitly catches them.\n\nAre you integrating causal inference into your ML pipelines yet?",
